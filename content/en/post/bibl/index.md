## 1. Use Bibliography Managers

One of the most effective ways to manage bibliography is to use specialized bibliography managers such as Zotero, Mendeley or EndNote. These tools allow you to organize and store all your sources in one place, add annotations and tags, and generate bibliography in a variety of formats. They integrate with your text editors, making it easy to insert citations and create bibliographic references.

## 2. Create annotations and notes

In addition to simply storing sources, it is also important to create annotations and notes for each of them. This will help you better organize your thoughts and quickly find the information you need when working on a project or writing an article. Some bibliography managers offer built-in annotation and note-taking tools, but you can also use regular text editors or note-taking applications.

## 3. Check Formatting

When writing academic papers or scientific articles, it is important to follow certain standards for formatting bibliographic references. Bibliography managers usually provide a choice of different citation styles, such as APA, MLA, Chicago, and others. Before submitting your work, make sure that all links are formatted correctly and comply with the requirements of the chosen style.
